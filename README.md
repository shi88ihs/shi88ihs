Hello and welcome to my back up config repo and practice projects. Iâ€™m known as palendrome shi88ihs here.
I interested in AI and ML when it comes to algo's like KNN and the rest and how they can be used in financial markets. 
I am honing my skills in bash scripting, pyhton, JS, NodeJS, and other Backend and front end web frameorks to gain employment and become a better web coder.

I am already a master in Linux System Admin Roles and have been using linux as a full time OS since 2009. 
 
I am ineterested in CoPilot AI auto coder extention. So thx M$ for letting me try it out after waiting a month on the wait list!
